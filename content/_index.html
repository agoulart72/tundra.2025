Tundra is a brutal, frozen land dominated by the great Frozen Sea, a continent-sized lake of solid ice. 
Amidst the desolate, snow-swept plains and jagged, ice-capped mountains, the Elven Empire reigns supreme. 
They are the masters of this world, a magically advanced and ruthless civilization that has carved out a 
decadent empire from the unforgiving landscape. Their cities, gleaming spires of ice and crystal, are 
built upon a foundation of subjugation, fueled by the immense power of mana crystals mined from deep within 
the earth.

For centuries, the dwarves have been their primary workforce, enslaved and forced to toil in the dangerous 
crystalline mines. But now, a great dwarven rebellion is underway. They have fled to newly-built mountain 
fortresses, sparking a conflict that threatens to shatter the Elven Empire's iron grip.

While the Elves command the land, their fleet of modified ships dominates the Frozen Sea and the surrounding 
oceans. These massive vessels, reinforced with enchanted hulls, ensure the empire's control over trade and 
travel. However, the icy waters are far from safe. Pirate ships, crewed by human renegades and the bestial 
Therions, constantly prey on the elven fleet, a perpetual thorn in the empire's side.

On the mainland, one city stands as an unyielding bastion against the Elven Empire: Tegoria. This city is 
ruled by a mysterious and powerful alien race, masters of psionic abilities. They effortlessly repel elven 
invasions, using their mental powers to turn aside armies and command colossal purple worms to devour all 
who dare approach.

This is a world of stark contrasts: a land of both breathtaking beauty and profound cruelty, where ancient 
magic clashes with brute force, and the struggle for freedom burns hot against the endless cold.
