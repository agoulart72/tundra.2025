The Hunter is a specialist who uses a blend of might and magic to track and defeat their enemies.

**Hunter Trait:** As an **action**, you can _mark_ one enemy that you can see. The mark lasts for a number of days equal to your **Awareness** score, or until you _mark_ a new enemy. You have **Expertise** on **Perception** rolls to track this enemy, and you can push attacks against this enemy without gaining **Stress**.

- **Inquisitor:** A hunter who uses their wits and divine favor to hunt down evil and magical creatures.
    - **Rank 1:** As an **action**, you can spend **1 WP** to focus your wits on a single creature. You instantly learn of the creature's weaknesses, resistances, and vulnerabilities. You also gain a **+1** bonus to all attack rolls against that enemy for a *stretch* (5-10 min).
        
    - **Rank 2:** When attacked with magic you can spend 1 **WP** to *push* any **Endurance**, **Resolve** or **Discipline** roll you need to make to resist that specific effect. 
        
    - **Rank 3:** When you make an attack against a *marked* enemy, if the attack succeeds, you can spend 1 **WP** to  *daze* this enemy until the end of the round.
        
- **Spellblade:** A Hunter who combines the grace of a warrior with the power of primal magic.
	- **Rank 1:** You learn the **Summoning** skill and can use it to cast spells. You receive one point to spend on this skill when you receive this talent. You also must choose one **Primal** discipline to learn your spells from.
    
	- **Rank 2:** When an opponent makes a **Melee** or **Ranged** attack against you, you can spend **1 WP** to add your **Summoning** skill to your defense roll.
	
    - **Rank 3:** As an **action**, you can spend 1 **WP** to imbue your weapon with elemental energy. This energy lasts for a *stretch*, and you may add your **Summoning** rank to any **Melee** attack you make, any damage caused by this extra dice are considered elemental damage. (e.g., fire, ice, lightning).      
    
- **Scout:** A Scout is a master of archery and skirmishing,  using subterfuge to outwit their foes.
    
    - **Rank 1:** You can spend 1 **WP** to *move* when there are one or more enemies *close* to you, no need for a **Mobility** roll,  and without retaliation from that enemy.
        
    - **Rank 2:** You gain *Expertise* in **Marksmanship** and **Mobility**.
        
    - **Rank 3:** If you successfully hit a target with a **Ranged** attack, and you haven't used all your actions, you can spend 2 **WP** to make another attack as an **action** against the same target.
