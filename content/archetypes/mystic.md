The Mystic is a caster who channels primal forces, their power tied to the natural world.

- **Druid:** A protector of the natural world, able to commune with beasts and command the elements.
    
    - **Rank 1:** Choose one discipline of primal magic as your **Specialty**. You gain **Expertise** when casting spells from this discipline,
        
    - **Rank 2:** You can now increase the Rank of spells from all magical disciplines you know by 1 to a maximum of 3.
        
    - **Rank 3:** As a **special action**, you can spend all of your accumulated **Wyrd** to transform into an animal. The transformation lasts for a number of shifts equal to the **Wyrd** spent. While transformed, you can attempt a **Summoning** roll to revert at the start of each new shift. Each time you fail to return, you gain one **scar**. You can have a number of **scars** equal to your **MIND** or **SOUL** score, whichever is higher.  If you gain a **scar** that takes you over your limit, you lose yourself to your inner beast and cannot retry until the next day. **Scars** can be removed by a full night's rest.
        
        
- **Shaman:** A mystic who communes with spirits, using their power to heal and protect their allies.
