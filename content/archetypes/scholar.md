Scholar Trait: The Scholar has a remarkable ability to acquire and retain knowledge. He receives 3 extra points to distribute on his skills at character creation. When you spend **Experience Points (XP)** to increase your rank in a skill, the cost is calculated as 4 times the next rank instead of 5. This applies to all skills.

    - **Rank 1:** As an **action**, you can spend **1 Willpower** to make a **Performance** roll. For each success, all allies in your zone immediately reduce **1 Stress**.

    - **Rank 3:** As an **action**, you can spend **1 WP** to make a **Performance** roll. You and all allies in the same zone receive a **+1** bonus to their attack and defense rolls, for a number of times rounds to the number of successes you achieve.
        
- **Occultist:** A scholar who delves into forbidden lore and dark secrets to gain power.
