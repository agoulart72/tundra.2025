The Darfell are a fearsome and imposing race of humanoids, their towering frames reaching up to ten feet tall. Their immense size and strength make them a formidable presence on the coasts of Tundra. Physically, they are defined by their dark skin, which is patterned with large, stark white patches, much like a killer whale. These unique markings are a source of great personal and tribal pride, acting as a natural form of identification; a Darfell can recognize kin and strangers alike by their distinct patterns. Their bodies are almost entirely hairless, and their hands are webbed, making them perfectly suited for their aquatic life. A wide mouth filled with sharp, conical teeth completes their intimidating appearance.

Living in small, nomadic tribes along the icy coastlines, the Darfell are master swimmers, their physiology allowing them to hold their breath for extraordinary lengths of time in the frigid waters. They are a hardy people, their lives revolving around the bounty of the sea, from fishing for sustenance to raiding for resources and glory. Their society is tribal and based on a Bronze Age level of technology, mirroring the scattered human clans of the plains. While they are a constant and powerful force on the coasts, their lack of advanced civilization keeps them largely separate from the conflicts of the Elven Empire and its subject races, save for the occasional raid for plunder.
