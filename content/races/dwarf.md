For centuries, the dwarves of Tundra were not masters of their own destiny but slaves to the Elven Empire. Stripped of their own culture and civilization, their lives were defined by toil and subjugation, forced to work in the dangerous mines of the northern mountains. This harsh existence, however, was born from a unique and invaluable characteristic: a natural resistance to magic.

While the Elves are masters of the arcane arts, they are vulnerable to the raw, untamed power of mana crystals. These crystals, found in large quantities in the northern peaks, are a powerful source of magical energy. The Elves learned to refine them to amplify spells and to serve as a long-term power source for magical constructs, such as their floating cities. However, the magical radiation within the mines was too potent for other races. Human and Darfell slaves perished or acquired grotesque mutations, but the dwarves, uniquely, were largely immune. They could work for years in the mines, suffering only minor, temporary side effects.

This long history of servitude began to change with the arrival of the Samsaram. One dwarf, a smith named Thorin, was captivated by their culture and a new vision for his people. Now known as Thorin Silver Hammer, he led a daring rebellion, escaping into the mountains with a group of his kin. They fortified an old mine and began to build anew, laying the foundation for a new dwarven civilization.

The Elven Empire has relentlessly hunted Thorin, but their efforts have only strengthened the resolve of the dwarves. The rebellion is growing, and with each successful escape, the empire's supply of precious mana crystals dwindles. The dwarves of Tundra are a people defined by a complex mix of fear and deep-seated resentment toward the Elves. While they are physically similar to dwarves in other fantasy settings, their recent history of slavery and their unique magical resistance sets them apart. They are a people forging a new identity in the fire of rebellion, determined to reclaim their freedom and their heritage.
