Humans in Tundra are a deeply divided species, split between two very different ways of life.

The first group consists of the "civilized" humans who live on the outskirts of Elven cities. They have embraced the Elven Empire's culture, hoping to benefit from its advanced society. Despite their efforts and adaptability, they are consistently treated as second-class citizens. The elves, while recognizing human resilience and their ability to thrive in almost any environment, see them as little more than a step above their former dwarven slaves. These city-dwelling humans are a desperate and often exploited people, clinging to the fringes of a civilization that will never truly accept them.

In stark contrast, the second group of humans are the nomadic tribes who roam the unforgiving plains west of the Frozen Sea. These tribes are fiercely independent and proud of their ancient traditions. They follow the seasons, hunting and gathering to survive the brutal wilderness. Every few years, many tribes gather at ancestral sites to trade and reconnect. They view the city-dwelling humans with contempt, seeing them as weak and having abandoned their heritage for a life of servitude.
