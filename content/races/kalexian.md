The Kalexian
The Kalexian are an alien race, masters of psionic power, who have made their home in the isolated city-state of Tegoria. Their physical appearance sets them apart from the native races of Tundra: they have leathery, tightly-stretched skin in shades of brown and green, pointed serrated ears, and dark hair that they almost always wear in a ponytail. Facial hair is rare, but a warriorâ€™s ponytail is a source of immense pride, its length a testament to their fighting prowess. In a duel, a victorious Kalexian can cut off their defeated opponent's ponytail, a public mark of their skill. Those who follow a pacifist path often shave their heads to display their beliefs.

While all Kalexians possess some degree of psionic ability, a select few dedicate themselves to honing their mental powers to a degree that can rival the greatest Elven wizards. The Elven Empire has tried to conquer Tegoria many times, but they have always been repelled by the psionic might of its defenders and their unique ability to command colossal purple worms. Despite their immense power, the Kalexian are content to remain within their city's walls and have never attempted to retaliate against the elves.

Tegoria is ruled by a council of seven masked individuals, the most powerful psionic masters of their kind. Rumors persist of a hidden king who rules the masters, but no one has ever seen this figure, and the masters go to great lengths to ensure no information about the monarch is ever revealed. Within the city, a strange phenomenon occurs: people sometimes vanish without a trace, often moments after showing a flash of fear. Aside from the elves, the Kalexians generally coexist peacefully with other races, and a few individuals from other species live within the city's walls. However, most Kalexians, save for a few exceptions, rarely venture outside the safety of their city.
