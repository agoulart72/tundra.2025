The Kalexians are an alien race, refugees from a world ravaged by dragons and their dragonkin armies. Arriving in Tundra less than a century ago, they found no welcome from the haughty Elven Empire. Instead, they were forced to scatter, a diaspora across the frozen land, simply to survive.

Some have found refuge with the rebelling dwarves in their mountain fortresses, while a few attempt to eke out an existence on the fringes of elven cities. However, most have congregated in a new city they built with blood, sweat, and magic: the city-state of Tegoria.

Their culture, though shattered by the dragons, was once highly advanced. The Kalexians are masters of astrology, mathematics, and engineering—remnants of a lost civilization that once rivaled the elves in its own way.

Their physical appearance sets them apart from the native races of Tundra: they have leathery, tightly-stretched skin in shades of brown and green, pointed serrated ears, and very flat upturned noses. Dark hair is almost always worn in a ponytail. Facial hair is rare, but a warrior’s ponytail is a source of immense pride, its length a testament to their fighting prowess. In a duel, a victorious Kalexian can cut off their defeated opponent's ponytail, a public mark of their skill. Those who follow a pacifist path often shave their heads to display their beliefs.

Their defining trait, however, is their strict, monotheistic religion. They adhere to a rigid set of dogmas and taboos, believing their singular deity is the only true god. This conviction leads them to view the faiths of other races as inferior, especially the animistic beliefs of the human tribes, causing social friction wherever they go. The Kalexians are a people haunted by their past and struggling to find their place in a world that does not want them.

Many Kalexians possess some degree of magical ability, and a select few dedicate themselves to honing these powers to a degree that can rival the greatest Elven wizards. The Elven Empire has tried to conquer Tegoria many times, but they have always been repelled by the magical might of its defenders and their unique ability to command colossal purple worms. Despite their immense power, the Kalexians are content to remain within their city's walls and have never attempted to retaliate against the elves.

Tegoria is ruled by a council of seven masked individuals, the most powerful wizards of their kind. Rumors persist of a hidden king who rules these masters, but no one has ever seen this figure, and the masters go to great lengths to ensure no information about the monarch is ever revealed. Within the city, a strange phenomenon occurs: people sometimes vanish without a trace, often moments after showing a flash of fear. Aside from the elves, the Kalexians generally coexist peacefully with other races, and a few individuals from other species live within the city's walls.
