###Samsaram###

The Samsaram are a race of blue-skinned humanoids, refugees from a world destroyed by dragons and their dragonkin armies. Arriving in Tundra less than a century ago, they found no welcome from the haughty Elven Empire. Instead, they were forced to scatter to survive, a diaspora across the frozen land. Some have found refuge in the psionic city of Tegoria, others have sought a new life with the rebelling dwarves in their mountain fortresses, while a few try to eke out an existence on the fringes of elven cities.

Physically, they resemble humans, save for their distinctive blue skin and milky, pupil-less eyes. Their culture, though shattered by the dragons, was once highly advanced. The Samsaram are masters of astrology, mathematics, and engineering, remnants of a lost civilization that once rivaled the elves in its own way.

Their defining trait, however, is their strict, monotheistic religion. They follow a rigid set of dogmas and taboos, believing their singular deity is the only true god. This makes them view the faiths of other races as inferior, especially the animistic beliefs of the human tribes, leading to social friction wherever they go. The Samsaram are a people haunted by their past and struggling to find their place in a world that does not want them.
