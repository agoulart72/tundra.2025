The Elves: Sun Elves
The Elven Empire is ruled by three distinct branches, the first of which is the Sun Elves. They are the dominant power during the spring and summer seasons of Tundra, a reflection of their deep reverence for the sun and their sacred element of fire. Physically, Sun Elves have light to tan skin, which they often adorn with intricate magical tattoos in vibrant red, yellow, and orange tones. Their hair, which ranges from light yellow to dark red, sometimes appears to be aflame with its shifting shades.

As a people, the Sun Elves are known for their arrogance and spiteful nature, possessing little patience for what they deem "lesser" races. Magic is held in the highest regard, and wizards are among the most respected and powerful members of their society. Their seat of power is a magnificent city at the southern end of the Frozen Sea. This city is built with a series of circular walls, each ring enforcing a strict social hierarchy. Only the most powerful and wealthy are granted access to the inner rings, while the common folk are confined to the outer sections.

At the heart of the city lies the Flame Throne, where the young Empress commands. Having ascended to the throne after the assassination of her father, she is wise beyond her years. However, her more liberal ideas often clash with the traditionalist views of her inner council, creating a simmering tension within the empire's highest echelons.
