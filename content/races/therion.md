The Therion are a diverse and widespread race of feral-looking humanoids who roam across Tundra. Their appearance is a captivating blend of human and wild mammal, with individuals exhibiting traits of wolves, big cats, bears, or foxes. All Therion are covered in thick fur, possess tails, and have formidable claws and fangs. However, the color, texture, and length of their fur can vary dramatically, making them the most physically diverse species on the continent.

Despite their savage appearance, most Therion are remarkably friendly and sociable, living well with other races, even the haughty Elves. They can be found scattered everywhere, from the fringes of Elven cities to human tribes and pirate ships. This wide-ranging lifestyle is a result of a deep-seated characteristic shared by all Therion: a powerful sense of wanderlust, which is particularly strong in their youth. The thought of settling down in one place for years is deeply unsettling to a Therion, and this innate need for movement is what drives many of them to join nomadic human tribes or the freewheeling life of a pirate.
