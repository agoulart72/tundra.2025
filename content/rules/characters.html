    </p>
    <p>
        Every <i>Talent</i> has three ranks. You normally start the game with rank 1 in each talent, but you can choose to
        forgo one general talent for starting the game with rank 2 in another.<br/>

        your Pride helps you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Dark Secret</h3> On the other hand, every character has some kind of trauma or weakness that affects him. The dark secret is 
        a tool for the GM, but can earn you extra XP if you role-play it during the session.

        and can affect social encounters. <br/>

        heard of you. <br/>
        Roll a number of D6s equal to your reputation score. The more successes, the more people know about you.   
    </p -->
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Gear</h1>
    <p>
        Living in the frozen lands is not easy and travel through the wilds is dangerous. <br/>
        You must write down all the items you are carrying on your character sheet.<br/>
        If it's not listed on your sheet, you don't have it with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your class determines what gear you can choose from the start of your game. <br/>
        You can carry a number of medium or regular items up to your carry limit (<b>BODY</b> x 2).<br/>
        Heavy items count as two regular items. Light items count as 1/2. <br/>
        Clothes and backpacks does not count toward encumbrance. <br/>
        Backpacks allow you to carry a number of extra items equal to your <b>BODY</b>, but it gives
        you a -2 modifier to your <i>Mobility</i> skill. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Consumables</h3>
        Some categories of items in the game are called consumables. Food, water, ammunition, torches
        are all consumables. <br/>
        For each consumable, you have a <i>Supply</i> rating. Each consumable counts as one regular item.
        At regular intervals (usually a day) you make a supply roll. You roll a dice equivalent to 
        the current supply rate. If you roll a 1 or 2, the supply rating is reduced by 1. When the supply
        rating reaches zero, you are out of consumables.
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="simple-table">
            <tr><th>Supply rating</th><th>dice</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>d4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>d6</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>d8</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>d10</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>d12</td></tr>
        </table>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
        Whenever the characters overcome an obstacle they achieve Victory Points (VP).
        During the game, the number of VP that the characters collect improve morale 
        of the group.<br/>
        For evey 3 VP on the group pool, you add a die to all of your rolls.

        into Experience Points (XP).
