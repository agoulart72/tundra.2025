    <h1>Attributes</h1>
    <p>
    Each character has 5 main attributes : 
        <ul>
            <li><b>BODY</b> - Represents strength, physical power, health and overall constitution. It affects attacks made with melee weapons and your stamina. [<b>Stamina</b>]</li>
            <li><b>AGILITY</b> - Represents dexterity, speed and coordination. It affects attacks made with ranged weapons, and your defensive skills. [<b>Reactions</b>]</li>
            <li><b>MIND</b> - Represents overall intelligence, reason and cognitive skills. Is also directly tied to your <i>Willpower</i>. [<b>Willpower</b>]</li>
            <li><b>AWARENESS</b> - Represents your instincts and your connection to the natural and supernatural worlds. Affects your senses and initiative. [<b>Initiative</b>]</li>
            <li><b>SOUL</b> - Represents your divine connection and spirituality. Affects channeling and stress. [<b>Stress</b>]</li>
        </ul>
    
    Values for these attributes varies between 2 and 5. <br/>
    Starting characters have a number of points to distribute among their attributes accordingly to their age, min 2, max 4. <br/>
    You can assign a 5 only to the key attribute of your chosen class or race.
    </p>
    <h2>Stamina</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Stamina</b> represents how much the character can endure physical punishment. <b>Stamina</b> is defined by the character's class, plus his <b>BODY</b> score. <br/>
        When an enemy attacks and hits the character, reduces his <b>Stamina</b> by the amount of damage caused, after reducing the damage by his defense and armor.<br/>
        If the character's <b>Stamina</b> reaches 0, any futher damage causes 1 <b>Wound</b>.<br/>
        <b>Stamina</b> is usually recovered by <i>resting</i> or <i>healing</i>, but some <i>talents</i> can also recover <b>Stamina</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>Reactions</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Reactions</b> are defensive actions your character takes when he is attacked. The character has a number of <b>Reactions</b> equal to the <b>AGILITY</b> score minus 1.<br/>
        During combat, you spend <b>Reactions</b> to try to dodge or block attacks directed at the character. <br/>
        If the character is attacked and you have no <b>Reactions</b> remaining, the character cannot dodge or block the attack.<br/>
        <b>Reactions</b> are restored at the beginning of the round. 
    </p>
    <h2>Willpower</h2>    
    <p>
        <b>Willpower</b> is a resource that you can spend to use the character's special abilities and talents.<br/>
        You gain 1 <b>Willpower</b> for every two successes you achieve on a roll. <br/>
        The maximum <b>Willpower</b> a character can have at any time is equal to the <b>MIND</b> score plus the amount of <b>Victory Points</b>.<br/>
        After <i>resting</i>, <b>Willpower</b> always resets to a value equal to the character's <b>MIND</b> score.
    </p>
    <h2>Stress</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Stress</b> represents your mental and emotional resilience. You can accumulate <b>Stress</b> up to your <b>SOUL</b> score without any effect. <br/>
        Any <b>Stress</b> above the character's <b>SOUL</b> score, adds <b>Stress</b> dice to your <i>push</i> rolls. <br/>
        When a <b>Stress</b> die results on a failure, this is a <b>critical failure</b>, and the character gains a <b>Condition</b>.<br/>
        After <i>resting</i>, <b>Stress</b> always resets to 0.
    </p>

<div>
    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <p>
        <i>Skills</i> are measured on a scale from 0 to 5. <br/>
        Starting character have a number of points to distribute among their skills accordingly to their age.<br/>
        Max starting skill level is 3 for your class skills.<br/>
        All other skills are limited to a starting level of 1. <br/>
        Magical skills are only available through <i>Talents</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-skilled : You can try to use any skill without training using only your attribute score, 
            however this tests are always made at -1 dice if the skill have specializations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specialization - Some skills have specialization, <br/>
        You may choose one specializations for each level you have in the skill. <br/> 
        You can try to use a specialization you don't have, but that is made at -1 dice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Expertise - Some talents give you Expertise on some skills<br/>
        When you have expertise on a skill you roll d8s instead of d6s on the skill dice for this skill.<br/>
        A d8 succeeds on a 7 or 8 result.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Talents</h1>
    <p>
        <i>Talents</i> are abilities that give you an advantage in the game. <br/>
        You get one talent for you class, another for your race and a number of general talents depending on your age.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every <i>Talent</i> has three ranks. You normally start the game with rank 1 in each talent, but you can choose to
        forgo one general talent for starting the game with rank 2 in another.<br/>
        You can increase your talent levels and learn new talents during the game.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Personality Traits</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>Pride</h3> There is something that your character is very proud of. This defines your character and makes him stand out.
        Once per game session you can make a call on your pride to get one automatic succes in a dice roll. You must justify how
        your Pride helps you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Dark Secret</h3> On the other hand, every character has some kind of trauma or weakness that affects him. The dark secret is 
        a tool for the GM, but can earn you extra XP if you role-play it during the session.
    </p>
    <!-- Forbidden Lands : Maybe dont use -->
    <!-- h3>Reputation</h3>
    <p>
        Every character has a <b>Reputation</b> score, which affect the chances of being recognized,
        and can affect social encounters. <br/>
        Your starting reputation score depends on your age : 
        <table class="simple-table">
            <tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Starting reputation</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Young</td><td>0</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Adult</td><td>1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Old  </td><td>2</td></tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you arrive at a new village, town or city, there is a chance that people there have 
        heard of you. <br/>
        Roll a number of D6s equal to your reputation score. The more successes, the more people know about you.   
    </p -->
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Gear</h1>
    <p>
        Living in the frozen lands is not easy and travel through the wilds is dangerous. <br/>
        You must write down all the items you are carrying on your character sheet.<br/>
        If it's not listed on your sheet, you don't have it with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your class determines what gear you can choose from the start of your game. <br/>
        You can carry a number of medium or regular items up to your carry limit (<b>BODY</b> x 2).<br/>
        Heavy items count as two regular items. Light items count as 1/2. <br/>
        Clothes and backpacks does not count toward encumbrance. <br/>
        Backpacks allow you to carry a number of extra items equal to your <b>BODY</b>, but it gives
        you a -2 modifier to your <i>Mobility</i> skill. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Consumables</h3>
        Some categories of items in the game are called consumables. Food, water, ammunition, torches
        are all consumables. <br/>
        For each consumable, you have a <i>Supply</i> rating. Each consumable counts as one regular item.
        At regular intervals (usually a day) you make a supply roll. You roll a dice equivalent to 
        the current supply rate. If you roll a 1 or 2, the supply rating is reduced by 1. When the supply
        rating reaches zero, you are out of consumables.
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="simple-table">
            <tr><th>Supply rating</th><th>dice</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>d4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>d6</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>d8</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>d10</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>d12</td></tr>
        </table>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
        Whenever the characters overcome an obstacle they achieve <b>Victory Points (VP)</b>. <br/>
        <b>Victory Points</b> temporarily increase <i>Willpower</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount of <b>VP</b> can vary from session to session. <br/>
        As a guideline : 
        <ul>
            <li>1 point : Easy obstacle (trap, puzzle, social encounter)</li>
            <li>2 points : Medium obstacle (average combat, chase, social conflict)</li>
            <li>3 points : Hard obstacle (long combat, achieve a minor goal)</li>
            <li>5 points : Boss fight (achieve a main goal)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        When the characters have the chance to <i>rest</i>, they convert all of their <b>Victory Points</b>
        into <b>Experience Points</b> (XP).
    </p>
    <p>
        Players may spend <b>XP</b> to improve their characters. You can only spend <b>XP</b> when the character <i>rests</i>.<br/>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Skills</i>: To increase a skill level by one step costs a number of XP equal to the skill level you 
        want to achieve multiplied by 5. <br/>
        Learning a new skill (at level 1) costs 5 XP. <br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Talents</i>: To increase your rank in a talent by one step costs a number of XP 
                    equal to the rank you want to attain muliplied by 10. <br/>
                    Learning a new talent costs 10 XP and requires a teacher with the talent. <br/>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <!-- TODO - learn new spells -->
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Personality Traits</i>: After a session you may change your Personality traits 
        as your pride and dark secret. Try to connect the change to something that has happened
        during the game.
