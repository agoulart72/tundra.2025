    <h1>Rounds & Actions</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>Round</h3>
        A round is about 5-10 seconds. The point in initative order at which you can act is called your turn.
        
        <h3>Player Initiative</h3>
        At the start of combat, players roll a single die each to determine the player order, ties are decided by the players.

        <h3>GM Initiative</h3>
        Each enemy has a static <i>default initiative score</i> listed in it's stat block. The GM rolls a number of dice equal to the number of players plus one and pick the highest value, if this beats all of the player rolls, then GM goes first.

        <h3>Turn Order</h3>
        All characters and enemies are placed on a single turn track in descending order of their initiative (from highest to lowest, alternating between player and GM). Any remaining enemies act at the end of the round.

        <h3>Actions</h3>
        Characters get a total of 3 actions per round. Usually you can use the same action only once per turn.
        Some <i>talents</i> allow you to take the same action again in the same turn. <br/>
        All actions are refreshed at the start of the round. <br/>        
        Examples of actions : <br/>
        <i>Move, Attack, Aim, Reload, First Aid, Intimidate, Cast a spell</i> <br/>

        <h3>Out of Turn Actions</h3>
        A player can attempt to take a single action out of it's turn. To do this, you must roll an <b>AWARENESS</b> check. 
        If the check succeeds you can execute your action before the action that you are interrupting (this action still count as one of your 3 actions). 
        If you fail the check you get a point of <b>Stress</b>. You can attempt this action only once per round.<br/><br/>
        If the player wants, he can delay one of his actions to happen after his own turn.<br/>
        At any time before the end of the round, the player can interrupt to use his delayed action.
        A delayed action happens after the current character or enemy turn.

        <h2>Reaction</h2>
        <b>Reactions</b> are defensive actions your character takes when he is attacked. The character has a number of <b>Reactions</b> equal to the <b>AGILITY</b> score minus 1.<br/>
        During combat, you spend <b>Reactions</b> to try to dodge or block attacks directed at the character. <br/>
        If the character is attacked and you have no <b>Reactions</b> remaining, the character cannot dodge or block the attack.<br/>
        <b>Reactions</b> are restored at the beginning of the round. 

        <h2>Special Actions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Aim</i> - If you aim, your next ranged attack gets a +2 modifier.</li>
            <li><i>Reload</i> - Some ranged weapons like bows and slings need to be reload every turn before you attack with them. For crossbows, you can keep your weapon loaded while you execute other actions.</li>
            <li><i>Dual wielding</i> - If you are fighting with two one-handed melee weapons, and one of them is a light weapon, you can use another action to use the Attack action again in the same turn, as long as you are using the other weapon. 
                in this case, you need to <i>split</i> your dice pool. Which means you must divide the number of dice from your Melee skill however you want. Your first attack is made with some of the dice from your pool,
                and the second attack uses the remaining. Weapon bonus dice are added after you split your pool.
            </li>
            <li><i>Stand Up</i> - If you are <i>prone</i>, you can stand up and move with the same action, but you must succeed on a Mobility roll.</li>
            <li><i>Jump</i> - You can move and jump in the same action, but you must you succeed on a Mobility or Athletics roll.</li>
            <li><i>Disengage</i> - If there are enemies in <i>close</i> combat with you, you must succeed on a Mobility roll to move. You need one success for each enemy close to you. If you fail, you take one <b>Stress</b>, and must spend an extra action to move.
                If the character doesn't have any actions left, he cannot move.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Zone & Range</h1>
    <p>
        A conflict is typically played out using a map. <br/>
        The map is divided into zones. A zone can be a room, a corridor, or an area of ground.
        Ths size of the zone can varies depending on the environment, but is usually no larger than 25 meters across.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Zones can have features, which may affects the actions performed within them.<br/>
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Cluttered: roll for <i>Mobility</i> when move into the zone. Failure means you fall.</li>
            <li>Dimly lit: <i>Perception</i> and <i>Ranged</i> attack rolls get a -2 modifier.</li>
            <li>Cramped: The character can only crawl and its impossible to use Heavy weapons like axes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Range</h3>
        The distance between your character and an enemy is divided into five range categories.
        <ul>
            <li>Close: The enemy is in the same zone, at arms-length, threatening the character.</li>
            <li>Short: A few meters away, in the same zone.</li>
            <li>Medium: In an adjacent zone, up to 25 meters away.</li>
            <li>Long: Up to one hundred meters, or four zones away.</li>
            <li>Distant: As far as the eye can see.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        As an <b>action</b>, a character can move from one zone to another adjacent zone.<br/>
        If there are one or more enemies <i>close</i> to the character, to be able to move to another zone you must make a <i>Mobility</i> roll. <br/>
        You need one <i>success</i> for each enemy <i>close</i> to you.
        If you fail, you take one <b>Stress</b>, and must spend an extra <b>action</b> to move. <br/> 
        If the character doesn't have any <b>actions</b> left, he cannot move.<br/>
        During your movement you can attempt to jump (roll <i>Athletics</i>), 
        or open an unlocked door as a <i>free action</i>. <br/>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Melee / Ranged Combat</h1>
    <p>
        To attack in Melee the character must be in the same zone as the enemy. Some weapons allow
        the character to attack enemies in Melee from an adjacent zone. <br/>
        When you attack in Melee, you make a <i>Melee</i> roll and add the weapon bonus. <br/>
        If the attack succeeds, it causes damage equal to the number of successes plus
        the weapon base damage. <br/>
        Enemies defenses are pre-calculated, and they can reduce the amount of damage caused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enemies have a pre-calculated damage on attacks. <br/>
        When an enemy attacks a character, you can use a <i>reaction</i> to make a defense roll. <br/>
        A character has a number of reactions per round equal to his <b>Agility Score</b> -1. <br/>
        The number of success reduces the damage the character would take.<br/>
        The most common defense rolls are: 
        <ul>
            <li><i>Mobility</i> - agility based skill to dodge attacks.</li>
            <li><i>Melee</i> - if you have a shield or a <i>parrying</i> weapon, you can try to block the attack.</li>
        </ul>
        If the character has no <i>reactions</i> left when attacked, the damage is only reduced by armour.
    </p> 
    <p>
        To attack with a Ranged weapon, you roll a <i>Marksmanship</i> skill plus the weapon bonus,
        then apply the following modifiers: 
        <table class="simple-table">
            <tr><th>Factor</th><th>Modifier</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Aim</td><td>+2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Close range</td><td>-3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Short range</td><td>-</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Medium range</td><td>-1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Long range</td><td>-2</td></tr>

            <tr><td>Small target</td><td>-1/-2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Dim light</td><td>-1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Darkness</td><td>-3</td></tr>
        </table>
        If you spend an <b>action</b> to <i>Aim</i>, you get a +2 modifier. <br/>
        If the character is <i>close</i> to the enemy, there is a -3 modifier to the attack.<br/> 
        *If you want to attack an enemy that is one range category farther than the max allowed by the weapon, 
        you must use an <i>Aim</i> action, with a total -3 modifier to the attack.<br/>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Weapons</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Bonus</i> - Indicates if the weapon grants any bonus to the attack.</li>
        <li><i>Damage</i> - Indicates the base damage of the weapon. This is the damage caused if the attack succeeds.</li>
        <li><i>Range</i> - The maximum range you can attack with this weapon. If not defined you must be at <i>close</i> range to attack with this weapon.</li>
        <li><i>Weight</i> - How many regular items the weapon counts as for encumbrance.</li>
        <li><i>Features</i> - Any special properties, including the type of damage the weapon causes (B - Bludgeon, P - Piercing, S - Slashing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Health & Damage</h1>
    <h2>Stamina</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Stamina</b> represents how much the character can endure punishment in combat. <b>Stamina</b> is defined by the character's class, plus his <b>BODY</b> score. <br/>
        When an enemy attacks and hits the character, reduces his <b>Stamina</b> by the amount of damage caused, after reducing the damage by his defense and armor.<br/>
        If the character's <b>Stamina</b> reaches 0, the character is <i>broken</i> and any futher damage causes 1 <b>Wound</b>.<br/>
        <b>Stamina</b> is usually recovered by <i>resting</i> or <i>healing</i>, but some <i>talents</i> can also recover <b>Stamina</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>Wounds</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Wounds</b> represents physical trauma suffered in combat, they are more dangerous than the small cuts and bruises represented by losing <b>Stamina</b>.<br/>
        For each <b>Wound</b> you suffer, roll on the <b>physical critical injuries</b> table.<br/>
        <b>Wounds</b> require longer periods of <i>resting</i> or magical healing to be restored.
    </p>
    <h2>Stress</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Stress</b> represents your mental and emotional resilience. You can accumulate <b>Stress</b> up to your <b>SOUL</b> score without any effect. <br/>
        Any <b>Stress</b> above the character's <b>SOUL</b> score, adds <b>Stress</b> dice to your rolls. <br/>
        When a <b>Stress</b> die results a success, this success is <b>NOT</b> added to your success total, however the character gains 1 <b>WP</b>. <br/>
        When a <b>Stress</b> die results on a failure, this is a <b>critical failure</b>, and the character gains a <b>condition</b>.<br/>
        After <i>resting</i>, <b>Stress</b> always resets to 0.
    </p>
    <h2>Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        When you roll <b>Stress</b> dice, and it results in a <b>critical failure</b> the character gains a condition. <br/>
        The condition may vary according to the Attribute used in the roll that resulted in failure.<br/>
        When the character is already afflicted by a condition, the number of <b>critical failures</b> must be greater than the current condition level to increase the condition. 
        If the number of <b>critical failures</b> is lower or equal to the current condition level, the character receives an extra <b>Stress</b>.<br/>
        If any condition goes over level 3, the character is broken and suffers a critical injury. <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Body/Agility - <b>Exhaustion</b> - Exhaustion reduces your number of actions by 1.</li>
            <li>Mind/Awareness - <b>Dazed</b> - Reduces your number of reactions by 1.</li>
            <li>Soul - <b>Fear</b> - When afraid you are unable to use your skills effectively, on any roll you reduce the total successes by 1.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
