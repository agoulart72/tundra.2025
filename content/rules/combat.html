    <h1>Rounds & Initiative</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>Round</h3>
        A round is about 5-10 seconds. The point in initative order at which you can act is called your turn.
        
        <h3>Player Initiative</h3>
        At the start of combat, players roll a single die each to determine the player order, ties are decided by the players.

        <h3>GM Initiative</h3>
        Each enemy has a static <i>default initiative score</i> listed in it's stat block. The GM rolls a number of dice equal to the number of players plus one and pick the highest value, if this beats all of the player rolls, then GM goes first.

        <h3>Turn Order</h3>
        All characters and enemies are placed on a single turn track in descending order of their initiative (from highest to lowest, alternating between player and GM). Any remaining enemies act at the end of the round.

        <h3>Actions</h3>
        Characters get a total of 3 actions per round. You cannot use the same action more than once on your turn, unless you have a talent that allows so.<br/>
        All actions are refreshed at the start of the round.

        <h3>Out of Turn Actions</h3>
        A player can attempt to take a single action out of it's turn. To do this, you must roll an <b>Awareness</b> check. 
        If the check succeeds you can execute your action before the action that you are interrupting (this action still count as one of your 3 actions). 
        If you fail the check you get a point of <b>Stress</b>. You can attempt this action only once per round.<br/><br/>
        If the player wants, he can delay one of his actions to happen after his own turn.<br/>
        At any time before the end of the round, the player can interrupt to use his delayed action.
        A delayed action happens after the current character or enemy turn.
    </p>

<div>
    <h1>Zone & Range</h1>
    <p>
        A conflict is typically played out using a map. <br/>
        The map is divided into zones. A zone can be a room, a corridor, or an area of ground.
        Ths size of the zone can varies depending on the environment, but is usually no larger than 25 meters across.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Zones can have features, which may affects the actions performed within them.<br/>
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Cluttered: roll for <i>Mobility</i> when move into the zone. Failure means you fall.</li>
            <li>Dimly lit: <i>Perception</i> and <i>Ranged</i> attack rolls get a -2 modifier.</li>
            <li>Cramped: The character can only crawl and its impossible to use Heavy weapons like axes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Range</h3>
        The distance between your character and an enemy is divided into five range categories.
        <ul>
            <li>Engaged : The enemy is right next to the character.</li>
            <li>Short/Near: A few meters away, in the same zone.</li>
            <li>Medium: In an adjacent zone, up to 25 meters away.</li>
            <li>Long: Up to one hundred meters, or four zones away.</li>
            <li>Distant: As far as the eye can see.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        Movement costs 1 action. <br/>
        A character can move from one zone to another adjacent zone.<br/>
        If the character has one or more enemies engaged, you must roll for <i>Mobility</i>,
        you need one <i>success</i> for each enemy engaged with you.
        If you fail, you must spend an extra action to move. <br/> 
        During your movement you can attempt to jump (roll <i>Athletics</i>), 
        or open an unlocked door. <br/>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h1>Melee / Ranged Combat</h1>
    <p>
        To attack in Melee the character must be engaged with the enemy. Some weapons allow
        the character to attack near enemies in Melee. <br/>
        When you attack in Melee, you roll the <i>Melee</i> skill plus the weapon bonus. <br/>
        If the attack succeeds, it causes damage equal to the number of successes plus
        the weapon base damage. <br/>
        Enemies defenses are pre-calculated, and they can reduce the amount of damage caused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enemies have a pre-calculated damage on attacks. <br/>
        When an enemy attacks a character, he can use a reaction to defend himself. <br/>
        A character has a number of reactions per round equal to his <b>Agility Score</b> -1. <br/>
        Reaction is an active defense, you can roll a defensive skill check, and the number of success reduces the damage the character would take.<br/>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Mobility</i> - agility based skill to dodge attacks.</li>
            <li><i>Melee</i> - if you have a shield or a <i>parrying</i> weapon, you can use Melee to try to block the incoming attack.</li>
        </ul>
        If the character has no reactions left when attacked, his only defense is his armour.
    </p> 
    <p>
        To attack with a Ranged attack, if the character is engaged with the enemy, he gets a -3 penalty. <br/> 
        If the enemy is in short or long range, some weapons cause a -1 or -2 modifier to the attack. <br/>
        Distant enemies have a -3 penalty to attack, and the character must spend an extra ation to <i>Aim</i>. <br/>
        You roll a <i>Marksmanship</i> skill plus the weapon bonus to attack with a ranged attack.
    </p>

<div>
    <h1>Weapons</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Grip</i> - Indicates if the character needs one or two hands to wield the weapon.</li>
        <li><i>Bonus</i> - Indicates if the weapon grants any bonus to the attack.</li>
        <li><i>Damage</i> - Indicates the base damage of the weapon. This is the damage caused if the attack succeeds.</li>
        <li><i>Range</i> - For ranged weapons indicates the penalties for short and long range.</li>
        <li><i>Weight</i> - How many regular items the weapon counts as for encumbrance.</li>
        <li><i>Features</i> - Any special properties, including the type of damage the weapon causes (B - Bludgeon, P - Piercing, S - Slashing)</li>

    <h1>Health & Damage</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Stamina</h2>
        <b>Stamina</b> represents how much the character can endure in combat. <b>Stamina</b> is defined by the character's class, plus his <b>BODY</b> score. <br/>
        When an enemy attacks and hits the character, reduces his <b>Stamina</b> by the amount of damage caused, after reducing the damage by his defense and armor.<br/>
        If the character's <b>Stamina</b> reaches 0, any futher damage causes 1 <b>Wound</b>.<br/>
        <b>Stamina</b> is usually recovered by <i>resting</i> or <i>healing</i>, but some <i>talents</i> can also recover <b>Stamina</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Wounds</h2>
        <b>Wounds</b> represents physical trauma suffered in combat, they are more dangerous than the small cuts and bruises represented by losing <b>Stamina</b>.<br/>
        For each <b>Wound</b>, you suffer a penalty of -1 to all of your dice rolls, including <i>pushes</i>.
        <b>Wounds</b> require longer periods of <i>resting</i> or magical healing to be restored.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Stress</h2>
        <b>Stress</b> is a different kind of attribute? each character can have.
